      Computer Science and Data Science at the University of Michigan-College of Engineering. Outside of school, I am always trying to learn new things, and to explore different hobbies. 
      Right now, I am learning more about ML, backend, and APIs (<a class="underline"  rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/TheOmid">github</a>). I am watching countless hours on YouTube about Sound Design, Music Production, and Audio Engineering. 
      I host my podcast, <a class="italic underline" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://anchor.fm/tat-podcast">Thoughts about Thoughts</a> podcast. Each month, I have a 
      conversation with my awesome guests about their life stories revolving around a topic related to personal growth and philosphy. I enjoy reading about philosphy, and I write about
      it in my <Link class="underline" to="/blog/">blog</Link> (coming soon!). My dream is to climb many mountains, and complete the <a class="underline" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://explorersgrandslam.com/">Explorers Grand Slam</a> Challenge.
      My life goal is to become a teacher or mentor for someone and inspire them like how my idol, Marcus Aurelius, inspires me everyday.
